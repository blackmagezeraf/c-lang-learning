# C Language Learning

## About Project
This repository only has basic C. No Advanced features or coding practices have been used here. This is purely my first time learning C Language. Code here is not for showcase or portfolio.

### Note! Learning from [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZPZq0r_RZOOzY_vR4zJM32SqsSInGMwe)

## Learning Goal
With this I am intending to learn the basics of C language to better grasp the concept of memory management and use this knowledge to apply in Odin language.
